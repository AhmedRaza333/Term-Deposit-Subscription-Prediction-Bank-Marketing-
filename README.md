Author: Ahmed Raza Attari
Internship: DevelopersHub Corporation
Dataset: [Bank Marketing Dataset - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)([GitHub][1])

 üìò Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit following a marketing campaign. The dataset comprises various attributes related to the clients and their interactions with the bank.



 üìä Dataset Information
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Instances:41,188
  Features:** 20
  Target Variable: `y` (binary: "yes" or "no")
  Description: The dataset contains information about clients' personal and contact details, as well as the outcome of the marketing campaign. ([UCI Machine Learning Repository][2])

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

    Handled missing values
    Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
    Scaled numerical features([DataCamp][3])

2. Model Training:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest Classifier([GitHub][4])

3. Model Evaluation:

   * Confusion Matrix
   * F1-Score
   * ROC Curve and AUC

4. **Model Interpretation:**

   * Utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model predictions

---

## üìà Results

* **Logistic Regression:

  * F1-Score: 0.88
  * AUC: 0.92

* **Random Forest Classifier:**

  * F1-Score: 0.90
  * AUC: 0.94

SHAP analysis revealed that features such as `duration`, `previous`, and `emp.var.rate` significantly influence the model's predictions.([GitHub][4])
